# A Python DAL Using [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/)

## Installation and Setup
First and foremost, you’ll need Python. Version 3 is assumed at this point because Python 2.x is at end-of-life, but many systems may still have both versions installed. For clarity, the commands given here will have `3` as a suffix (`python3`, `pip3`), but if your machine only has Python 3 installed, then that suffix can be dropped (and indeed might not work).

Python has a module called `venv` (short for “virtual environment”) which allows developers to create a local Python environment where third-party libraries can exist without having to modify the system-level Python installation. This is similar to how having a _node_modules_ folder in a JavaScript code base allows libraries and packages to be installed there without modifying the overall system.

To initialize a local Python environment, run this [while `cd`’ed to this folder](.):

    cd python # Within this repository
    python3 -m venv env

This will initialize the environment and create a folder called _env_. This folder is specific to the development machine and should _not_ be committed to the repository (thus it should be listed in _.gitignore_).

To begin working within this environment, run this before starting to work (also while at the top of the code base):

    source env/bin/activate

This “activates” the environment so that you can now install libraries in the local setup without having the change the global one. You can tell when `virtualenv` is active by checking if `(env)` precedes your command line prompt. When `(env)` is on, you can now install the libraries needed by our DAL:

    pip3 install SQLAlchemy
    pip3 install psycopg2-binary

It is important that you run `pip3 install` strictly _after_ you have set up and activated the virtual environment, because otherwise, Python will attempt to install the package _globally_ and this is generally no longer viewed as a recommended practice.

Once installed, there is no need to install again for that code base. Only `source env/bin/activate` needs to be invoked per work session. To “disconnect” from the environment, type:

    deactivate
    
You will notice how, when the environment is inactive, you can’t run or use the DAL code because you’re “outside” the environment at that point—the SQLAlchemy library and lower-level direct PostgreSQL library won’t be visible.

## Running the Examples
The reusable DAL code itself is in _netflix_dal.py_. It has four sample DAL functions, implemented using a variety of the aforementioned styles for illustration purposes. Each DAL function has a sample program that provides a simple command-line mechanism for calling that function. The general pattern for invoking these programs is:

    DB_URL=<database URL> python3 <program name> <arguments>

So, running _ratings_by_viewer.py_ for a database server on your local machine would look like this:

    DB_URL=postgresql://localhost/postgres python3 ratings_by_viewer.py 83

The programs all include some rudimentary error checking and handling—the patterns for implementing these should be pretty well-ingrained by now, but if anything needs further exposition please don’t hesitate to ask.
