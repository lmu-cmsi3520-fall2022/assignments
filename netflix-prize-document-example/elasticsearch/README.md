# An Elasticsearch Mini-Stack for the Netflix Prize Data
Interacting with Elasticsearch directly will need some adjustment‚Äîinstead of a command-line interface, Elasticsearch‚Äôs ‚Äúcommands‚Äù are all delivered as web requests. Yes, there are user interfaces available that go on top of that ([Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/kibana) being their own home-grown offering), but the fact of the matter remains that this is a cleanly-delineated layer.

As such, you will want to have some familiarity with a client that ‚Äúspeaks‚Äù web requests. _curl_ is a command line option and is very convenient as long as you know how to pick the method to use, set headers, and populate its payload‚Äîthis last aspect is particularly important for data loading. If you‚Äôre working with smaller chunks of data, [Postman](https://www.postman.com) is the more approachable tool‚Äîyou still need to know your web request basics but once you do, making requests is quite straightforward.

## Initialization: Mappings and Settings
As mentioned in the [overview](..), Elasticsearch doesn‚Äôt overtly require a schema but it _does_ attempt to guess one once documents are loaded to an index. Its guesses can sometimes be accurate, but sometimes an override is called for. This is the case for our nested _ratings_ array: Elasticsearch‚Äôs default approach to handling arrays doesn‚Äôt correspond to how we want to use _ratings_, so we must start by setting a _mappings_ object for our _movies_ index before we do any work.

**This is one major caution with Elasticsearch:** Once an index has documents loaded, the _mappings_ object _cannot_ be changed. It‚Äôs flat-out necessary to delete an index and start it over with a new _mappings_ definition if you realize that your mappings have to change. While still finalizing how to use your dataset, keep your loader programs handy and see if you can work with a subset of the data first, in case you need to start over with an index.

Back to our dataset, we will want to treat our _ratings_ objects as `nested`‚Äîin other words, we want to retain their structures as objects. The [`nested` field type page](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/nested.html) describes the distinction between ‚Äúflattened‚Äù arrays (the default Elasticsearch behavior) and `nested` ones (what we want here).

Thus, we start our _movies_ index by setting (`PUT`ting) the `mappings` object defined in [_movies-mappings.json_](./movies-mappings.json):

```http
PUT http://localhost:9200/movies
```
```json
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "ratings": {
        "type": "nested"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The size of our dataset also necessitates a change in _settings_‚Äîsettings are what you‚Äôd expect: various configuration values that customize the behavior of an index. It turns out that nested arrays have a maximum size‚Äîand our dataset exceeds the default. So we change the setting‚Äîthat‚Äôs what settings are for, after all:

```http
PUT http://localhost:9200/movies/_settings
```
```json
{
  "index.mapping.nested_objects.limit": 250000
}
```

### Ctrl-Alt-`DELETE` Method
When there‚Äôs a need to start over, you‚Äôll want to use the `DELETE` method on your index‚Äôs URL. Handy when needed‚Äîbut use with caution!

```http
DELETE http://localhost:9200/movies
```

## Doc and Load
Time to load up the index! We load in two phases: first, we send the movies (without ratings) to the index, then we‚Äôll load the ratings into each movie.

### The Incredible *_bulk*
For [_movie_loader.py_](./movie_loader.py), we make use of an index‚Äôs [*_bulk* endpont](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-bulk.html): sort of a ‚Äúshortcut‚Äù endpoint that can take a large chunk of JSON representing multiple documents.

*_bulk* does have its limits, but fortunately our _movie_titles.csv_ file is within those limits. If this turned out to be too large for a single *_bulk* call, we would need to write some code the break up the output into more digestible chunks.

Your can run [_movie_loader.py_](./movie_loader.py) all by itself to see what *_bulk*‚Äôs payload looks like:

    python3 movie_loader.py

When you‚Äôre ready to load for real, we just pipe its output to an invocation of _curl_ that invokes *_bulk* with payload coming from standard input:

    python3 movie_loader.py | curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -XPOST "localhost:9200/movies/_bulk?pretty&refresh" --data-binary @-

The `pretty` parameter formats the resulting response for human readability; the `refresh` parameter tells Elasticsearch to make the loaded data available _immediately_‚Äîif you‚Äôre curious about that, you can [read some details here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-refresh.html).

### Rated R for _requests_
The *_bulk* endpoint won‚Äôt work for ratings because we‚Äôre _nesting_ the ratings as arrays within each movie document. Because this approach means that loading ratings will _update_ each movie document, we‚Äôll instead use the [*_update*](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-update.html) endpoint. Further, because we‚Äôre only updating _part_ of the movie documents‚Äîi.e., we don‚Äôt want to wipe out the attributes that are already there‚Äîwe‚Äôll use the variant that performs a [partial update](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-update.html#_update_part_of_a_document).

This approach means that we‚Äôll need to gather up the entire list of ratings per movie. Fortunately, our overall structure for processing the _combined_data_ files still holds, except this time, we build up all of the ratings for a given movie into one array. Then, we send that array to *_update*.

This approach means that we need to make our *_update* requests _within_ the [_rating_loader.py_](./rating_loader.py) program. To do this, we use the Python _requests_ library. Thus, _rating_loader.py_ needs a virtual environment so that we can install _requests_:

    cd elasticsearch # Within this repository
    python3 -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate
    pip3 install requests

Once that‚Äôs done (and the _combined_data_ files are present), it‚Äôs a matter of running the program:

    python3 rating_loader.py

Contrary to what one might expect from a loader that uses web requests to do its work, the _rating_loader.py_ compares well in performance to movie creation (via ratings) with _mongoimport_. Both loaders appear to perform very similarly‚Äîaround seven (7) times faster than the `INSERT`-based relational database loader.

## Sample Queries
Because Elasticsearch is document-centric, it returns, well‚Ä¶documents. All queries are done via the [*_search* endpoint](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-search.html), and Elasticsearch‚Äôs ‚Äúquery language‚Äù consists of specially-formatted JSON payloads.

Query conditions go in a `query` object within the *_search* payload. This so-called [‚ÄúQuery DSL‚Äù](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl.html) (domain-specific language) is quite a beast‚Äîwe highlight examples here but be aware that there‚Äôs a _lot_ more available.

Because we are embedding _ratings_ in each movie, Elasticsearch‚Äôs default behavior of returning the entire document can be unwieldy‚Äîthus, we use the [`_source` property](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-fields.html) to omit the _ratings_ array when desired.

Elasticsearch is conservative about the default number of results that it returns for a query. Because of this, [pagination parameters](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/paginate-search-results.html) may be needed more often than in other databases. Put simply, this consists of a `from` property to indicate where to start and a `size` property to indicate how many results to return. Both properties are peers of the `query` object in the payload.

Because Elasticsearch‚Äôs primary function is document search, it has a unique ‚Äúfree‚Äù feature‚Äîit provides a _relevance score_ for its search results, and by default it will sort by relevance. Manual sorting remains available, but due to this distinctive behavior, it will also be interesting to see what the score-based sorting may be for the queries that you write. This is actually Elasticsearch‚Äôs _raison d‚Äô√™tre_, and to some degree we are giving it short shrift because we‚Äôre approaching Elasticsearch as ‚Äújust‚Äù a database here. Worth exploring further if it‚Äôs your cup of tea üçµ

### Basic Matching and Logical Combinations
The [`match`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-match-query.html) and [`bool`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-bool-query.html) constructs are good starting points‚Äî`match` defines text-matching or equality conditions, and `bool` helps to combine these conditions (and other conditions as well).

All text-matching queries in Elasticsearch are _case-insensitive_ by default‚Äîindeed, if you want to allow case-sensitive searching, you _actually have to plan for this ahead of time_ and include this customization in the _mappings_. We didn‚Äôt bother to do this which is why some of the results you‚Äôll see may differ from what was seen in other databases.

To sort manually (i.e., not by relevance), a `sort` property can be specified as a peer of `query`. As you‚Äôll see from the results, the sort fields are _repeated_ in a `sort` array‚Äîthus, in some cases, you can potentially _skip the documents entirely_ (`_source: false`) if the only data you want are wholly contained in the `sort` fields.

* List movies containing both `'and'` and `'of'` in their titles, sorted ascending by year then title:
```http
GET http://localhost:9200/movies/_search?pretty
```
```json
{
  "_source": {
    "excludes": ["ratings"]
  },
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must": [
        { "match": { "title": "and" } },
        { "match": { "title": "of" } }
      ]
    }
  },
  "sort": ["year", "title.keyword"]
}
```
Here‚Äôs a subset of the response:
```json
{
  "_index": "movies",
  "_type": "_doc",
  "_id": "3790",
  "_score": null,
  "_source": {
    "year": 1921,
    "title": "Avant-Garde: Experimental Cinema of the 1920s and '30s"
  },
  "sort": [
    1921,
    "Avant-Garde: Experimental Cinema of the 1920s and '30s"
  ]
},
{
  "_index": "movies",
  "_type": "_doc",
  "_id": "10827",
  "_score": null,
  "_source": {
    "year": 1939,
    "title": "Of Mice and Men"
  },
  "sort": [
    1939,
    "Of Mice and Men"
  ]
},
...
...
```
Fun exercise: remove the `sort` to see what the _ranked_ order looks like.

We enlist [`range`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-range-query.html) when we want to specify conditions with numbers or dates.

* List movie titles released in the 20th century with the substring `'future'` in their titles, case-insensitively, sorted ascending by title:
```http
GET http://localhost:9200/movies/_search?pretty
```
```json
{
  "_source": {
    "excludes": ["ratings"]
  },
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must": [
        { "match": { "title": "future" } },
        { "range": { "year": { "lt": 2001 } } }
      ]
    }
  },
  "sort": "title.keyword"
}
```
This returns (partly):
```json
{
  "_index": "movies",
  "_type": "_doc",
  "_id": "10820",
  "_score": null,
  "_source": {
    "year": 1985,
    "title": "Back to the Future"
  },
  "sort": [
    "Back to the Future"
  ]
},
{
  "_index": "movies",
  "_type": "_doc",
  "_id": "4956",
  "_score": null,
  "_source": {
    "year": 1989,
    "title": "Back to the Future Part II"
  },
  "sort": [
    "Back to the Future Part II"
  ]
},
...
...
```

### Nested Objects and Aggregations
Elasticearch‚Äôs [aggregations feature set](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations.html) is quite intimidating‚Äîand quite different. These are some initial takeaways:
* Aggregations are specified in an `aggs` property which is a peer of `query`‚Äîin other words, you specify the conditions first, then you specify what aggregated values you want from those results
* Each `aggs` object defines one or more aggregations, each with its own user-given property name‚Äîthis will serve as the aggregation result‚Äôs attribute name
* Each aggregation object then defines the aggregation to perform‚Äîsuffice it to say you have tons of possibilities here
* One such aggregation that‚Äôs of particular use here is the [`nested` aggregation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-bucket-nested-aggregation.html)‚Äîthis defines aggregations on _nested_ objects such as our ratings. A `nested` aggregation then itself has an `aggs` object, which defines the aggregation to perform on those nested objects plus an optional `filter` on those objects (to determine just which nested objects to use). It‚Äôs like [_Inception_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception) for databases üò±

By default, Elasticsearch again returns the documents that were used in the aggregate calculation‚Äîbut sometimes you don‚Äôt care to see those documents (like in some samples below). This is another good use for `size: 0`‚Äîthis will return _no_ document results but the aggregation value will still come back.

* Determine the average rating given by all viewers on the month of October, 2004:
```http
GET http://localhost:9200/movies/_search?pretty
```
```json
{
  "_source": false,
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "all_ratings": {
      "nested": {
        "path": "ratings"
      },
      "aggs": {
        "october_2004_only": {
          "filter": {
            "range": { "ratings.date_rated": { "gte": "2004-10-01", "lte": "2004-10-31" } }
          },
          "aggs": {
            "avg_rating": { "avg": { "field": "ratings.rating" } }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
The average does take some navigating, but gets (somewhat) more readable if you look at it in dot notation: `aggregations.ratings.october_2004_only.avg_rating.value`.
```json
{
  "took": 2,
  "timed_out": false,
  "_shards": {
    "total": 1,
    "successful": 1,
    "skipped": 0,
    "failed": 0
  },
  "hits": {
    "total": {
      "value": 10000,
      "relation": "gte"
    },
    "max_score": null,
    "hits": []
  },
  "aggregations": {
    "all_ratings": {
      "doc_count": 100480507,
      "october_2004_only": {
        "doc_count": 2860409,
        "avg_rating": {
          "value": 3.6811938432580797
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `nested` construct also applies to non-aggregating queries on nested objects. Instead of nesting another `aggs` object, we nest another `query` within the `query`. Maybe they should call this system Inceptionsearch‚Ä¶

* List the titles of movies that got a rating of 1 on December 25, 2002, sorted ascending by title:

```

  "query": {
    "nested": {
      "path": "ratings",
      "query": {
        "bool": {
          "must": [
            { "match": { "ratings.rating": 1 } },
            { "match": { "ratings.date_rated": "2002-12-25" } }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "sort": "title.keyword"
}
```
‚Ä¶with partial results:
```json
{
  "_index": "movies",
  "_type": "_doc",
  "_id": "10198",
  "_score": null,
  "sort": [
    "102 Dalmatians"
  ]
},
{
  "_index": "movies",
  "_type": "_doc",
  "_id": "10226",
  "_score": null,
  "sort": [
    "13 Conversations About One Thing"
  ]
},
...
...
```

Grouped aggregations are called [buckets](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-bucket.html) in Elasticsearch. Grouping by value is known as a [`terms`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-bucket-terms-aggregation.html) bucket. Sorting such grouped/bucketed aggregations then requires a [`bucket_sort`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-pipeline-bucket-sort-aggregation.html) aggregation. Whew!

## DAL Details
We have chosen to implement our sample Elasticsearch DAL in Python. If you prefer another language, [take your pick from here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/index.html).

The official high-level Python library for Elasticsearch is [Elasticsearch DSL](https://elasticsearch-dsl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), taking its name ‚ÄúDSL‚Äù from the way that Elasticsearch‚Äôs query language is characterized as a DSL (domain-specific language). Thus, to run the DAL code, you‚Äôll need to add that to your virtual environment (of course making one if you haven‚Äôt yet):

    source env/bin/activate
    pip3 install elasticsearch-dsl

The DAL code is structured like the other mini-stacks: _netflix_dal.py_ is the data access layer itself, with its setup code and DAL functions. The remaining programs are mini-applications that demonstrate one DAL function each. You‚Äôll notice that these programs are very similar to their equivalents in other mini-stacks‚Äîbut they aren‚Äôt _completely_ identical due to specific behaviors or features in Elasticsearch. Study the code and read their comments to learn about what makes this DAL (and its functions) different from others.

Like our other DALs, we separate configuration information from the code. But _unlike_ our other DALs, Elasticsearch, as a web service, only needs host and port information. We‚Äôre staying with the default port so we only supply a host, using an `ES_HOST` environment variable. In the end, you do still set an environment variable indicating your configuration, but this time it‚Äôs `ES_HOST` with just a hostname instead of `DB_URL` with a full URL:
    
    ES_HOST=<Elasticsearch hostname/IP> python3 <program name> <arguments>

Running _ratings_by_viewer.py_ for an Elasticsearch server on your local machine would look like this:

    ES_HOST=localhost python3 ratings_by_viewer.py 83
